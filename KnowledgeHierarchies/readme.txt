# KnowledgeHierarchies
Knowledge Representation and Logic
========================================================================
This project demonstrates how to get started writing XAML apps directly
with standard C++, using the C++/WinRT SDK component and XAML compiler
support to generate implementation headers from interface (IDL) files.
These headers can then be used to implement the local Windows Runtime
classes referenced in the app's XAML pages.

Steps:
1. Create an interface (IDL) file to define any local Windows Runtime
    classes referenced in the app's XAML pages.
2. Build the project once to generate implementation templates under
    the "Generated Files" folder, as well as skeleton class definitions
    under "Generated Files\sources".
3. Use the skeleton class definitions for reference to implement your
    Windows Runtime classes.

Knowledge Representation and Logic
automated methods include artificial intelligence (AI),
which we think of as a set of technologies that enable computers to perceive,
learn, reason, and assist in decision-making to solve problems...
...in ways that are similar to what people do.
 We manually review short snippets of a small sampling of voice data
 (we have taken steps to de-identify this voice data)
 {
  by using a computing standard
  in which sensitive medical information
  contained in electronic health records (EHR)
  can be made unusable
  so that unauthorized users
  are unable to read the actual content
  since it is no longer in its original state

   While (authorized users)
        {
            Continue to improve our speech services, such as recognition and translation.
        }
  }

  Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run
modified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer
can do so.  This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of
protecting users' freedom to change the software.  The systematic
pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to
use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable.  Therefore, we
have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those
products.  If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we
stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions
of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.

  Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.
States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of
software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to
avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could
make it effectively proprietary.  To prevent this, the GPL assures that
patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.

  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow.

                       TERMS AND CONDITIONS

  0. Definitions.

  "This License" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.

  "Copyright" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of
works, such as semiconductor masks.

  "The Program" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this
License.  Each licensee is addressed as "you".  "Licensees" and
"recipients" may be individuals or organizations.

  To "modify" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work
in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an
exact copy.  The resulting work is called a "modified version" of the
earlier work or a work "based on" the earlier work.

  A "covered work" means either the unmodified Program or a work based
on the Program.

  To "propagate" a work means to do anything with it that, without
permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for
infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a
computer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes copying,
distribution (with or without modification), making available to the
public, and in some countries other activities as well.

  To "convey" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other
parties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user through
a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.

  An interactive user interface displays "Appropriate Legal Notices"
to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible
feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)
tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the
extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the
work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.  If
the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a
menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.

  1. Source Code.

  The "source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work
for making modifications to it.  "Object code" means any non-source
form of a work.

  A "Standard Interface" means an interface that either is an official
standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of
interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that
is widely used among developers working in that language.
